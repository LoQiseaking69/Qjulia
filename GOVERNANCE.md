# Governance Document for Qjulia and Future Projects

## 1. Introduction
This governance framework applies to the Qjulia project and all future projects under our development. Our overarching goal is to align each project with the principles and standards of NumFOCUS, aiming for fiscal sponsorship and contributing to the open-source scientific community.

## 2. Mission and Vision
The primary aim of Qjulia, and all subsequent projects, is to explore unique scientific and mathematical concepts, such as the intersection of set theory and infinity in Qjulia's case. These projects will collectively contribute to advancing scientific understanding and education in their respective fields.

## 3. Team Structure and Roles
While currently led by a solo developer, the aim is to expand into a collaborative team for each project, sharing a commitment to the NumFOCUS ethos.

### Prospective Roles:
- **Project Lead**: Directs the project, ensuring alignment with both the project's thematic focus and NumFOCUS standards.
- **Maintainers**: Responsible for overseeing code quality and steering the project's technical development.

## 4. Contributor Engagement
We invite contributors who are enthusiastic about scientific exploration and who are committed to the principles of open-source development as advocated by NumFOCUS.

## 5. Decision-Making Process
- Decisions are made with an eye towards fulfilling NumFOCUS standards, transitioning from a solo-led approach to a more collaborative model as each project team expands.
- Decisions will always support the project's scientific integrity and its alignment with NumFOCUS.

## 6. Contribution Standards
- Contributions should be innovative and scientifically relevant, contributing to the project's goals and the broader vision of aligning with NumFOCUS.
- Contributors have the opportunity to significantly impact the project's direction and success.

## 7. Conflict Resolution
- Conflicts are resolved through open dialogue, prioritizing mutual understanding and respect.
- The resolution process will evolve from solo mediation to a collective approach as teams grow.

## 8. Community Development
- We strive to build communities around each project that embody the values of NumFOCUS and the project's specific scientific goals.
- Engagement, collaboration, and mentorship will be key aspects of community interaction.

## 9. Amendments to Governance
- This governance structure is dynamic and will evolve alongside each project, reflecting changes in team structure and community feedback.
- Active participation from the community is encouraged for governance evolution.

## 10. Code of Conduct
- All projects adhere to a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CONDUCT.md), emphasizing a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative environment.

## 11. Licensing
- Our projects are released under open-source licenses like the MIT License to promote wide participation and collaboration in line with NumFOCUS's vision.
